In the North of the island nation, he stood,
A leader named Prabhakaran, brave and good.
Fighting for his people, for their freedom,
In the annals of history, a unique kingdom.

In the face of adversity, he did not falter,
His resolve like an unyielding, mighty alter.
His mission was clear, his vision resolute,
For the rights of his people, he would dispute.

Prabhakaran, a name echoing still,
In the hearts of those, he sought to instill,
A sense of identity, a sense of pride,
For the land they love, for which they've cried.

A tale of courage, a tale of might,
In the face of injustice, he chose to fight.
Prabhakaran, a legacy etched in time,
A symphony of freedom, a poignant rhyme.
